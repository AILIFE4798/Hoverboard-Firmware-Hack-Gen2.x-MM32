* This file is part of the hoverboard-firmware-hack-V2 project. The 
* firmware is used to hack the generation 2 board of the hoverboard.
* These new hoverboards have no mainboard anymore. They consist of 
* two Sensorboards which have their own BLDC-Bridge per Motor and an
* ARM Cortex-M3 processor GD32F130C8.

* The program is based on the hoverboard project by Niklas Fauth. The 
* structure was tried to be as similar as possible, so that everyone
