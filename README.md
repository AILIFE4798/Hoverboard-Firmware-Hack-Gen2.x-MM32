# this is a temporary Keil project compiling the firmware for the Gen2.x hoverboard for the MM32 mcu.

## https://github.com/RoboDurden/Hoverboard-Firmware-Hack-Gen2.x with all its different layout images and pdf manuals has become to large.
### documentation wills still be updated there but firmware is now here :-)
